# EKG Masterclass

## I. Introduction

-   The heart requires a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to function.
-   Coronary circulation is the blood flow through the heart's blood vessels.
-   Understanding coronary circulation is crucial for:
    -   Interpreting electrocardiograms (EKGs)
    -   Understanding coronary artery disease
    -   Evaluating interventions for heart attacks (myocardial infarction)

## II. Cardiac Cycle and Coronary Blood Flow

-   Systole: Heart contraction; no blood flow to the heart muscle.
-   Diastole: Heart relaxation; aortic valve closes, allowing retrograde blood flow into the coronary arteries.
-   Key Difference: Most tissues receive blood flow during systole, while the heart receives its primary blood supply during diastole.

## III. Coronary arteries and the anatomy of the heart

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_arteries

-   Myocardial infarction (heart attack) occurs when one or more coronary arteries become blocked, supplying blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. Plaque buildup, a mixture of cholesterol, fat, and other substances, is the most common cause of blockage. Reduced blood flow deprives the affected heart muscle of oxygen and nutrients, causing cell death and heart attack.

-   Coronary artery disease and arrhythmias are related. Ischemia, caused by narrowed or blocked arteries, disrupts heart electrical signals and increases the risk of arrhythmias. Scar tissue formed after a heart attack further disrupts normal electrical pathways, raising the risk of arrhythmias. Additionally, a weakened heart muscle makes it more susceptible to developing abnormal rhythms.

-   The left coronary artery originates from the aorta in the left cusp of the aortic valve and supplies blood to the left side of the heart. It branches into the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. The left anterior descending artery supplies the interventricular septum and left ventricle's anterior wall, while the left circumflex artery supplies the left ventricle's free wall. In about 33% of individuals, the left coronary artery gives rise to the posterior descending artery, which supplies the left ventricle's posterior and inferior walls. Occasionally, a third branch, known as a ramus or intermediate artery, forms at the fork between the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries.

-   The right coronary artery originates in the right aortic cusp, travels down the right coronary sulcus, and branches into the right marginal arteries. In 67% of individuals, it also gives way to the posterior descending artery. The right marginal arteries supply the right ventricle, while the posterior descending artery perfuses the left ventricular posterior and inferior walls. The conus artery, present in about 45% of people, provides collateral blood flow to the heart when the left anterior descending artery is blocked.

## IV. Physiology of the Coronary Circulation

-   High Oxygen Demand

    -   The heart needs the most oxygen of any organ in the body.
    -   It uses a large portion (60-70%) of the oxygen delivered to it, even at rest.
    -   At rest, the heart receives about 250-300 milliliters of blood per minute.
    -   During exercise, this can increase to 1,000-2,000 milliliters per minute.

-   Blood Flow During Heartbeat

    -   Most blood flow to the heart happens during the resting phase (diastole).
    -   Heart contractions squeeze the blood vessels, reducing blood flow during the pumping phase (systole).
    -   This is mostly true for the left side of the heart.
    -   The right side of the heart receives blood more consistently.

-   Angiogenesis

    -   The heart can grow new blood vessels (angiogenesis) to improve blood flow when needed.
    -   This helps when existing blood vessels are narrowed.

-   Active hyperemia is a physiological response that occurs when the body increases blood flow to an organ or tissue in response to a greater demand for oxygen and nutrients

    -   Blood flow to the heart increases when the heart's workload increases (active hyperemia).
    -   This is because the heart needs more oxygen.
    -   Factors like heart rate, pressure, and how strongly the heart contracts all increase the heart's workload.

-   Regulation of Blood Flow

    -   Sympathetic Nervous System: Increases heart rate and workload. Initially causes slight vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels). This is quickly overcome by the need for more blood flow.
    -   Parasympathetic Nervous System: Slows down the heart. Initially causes slight vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). Leads to decreased blood flow as less oxygen is needed.

-   Vasoactive mediators are substances that cause blood vessels to constrict or dilate.

    -   Adenosine (vasodilator): A key chemical that helps regulate blood flow. Produced when oxygen demand is high.
    -   Nitric Oxide (vasodilator): A powerful chemical that relaxes blood vessels.
    -   Endothelin (vasoconstrictor): A chemical that constricts blood vessels when oxygen demand is low.

## V. Cardiac Conduction System (CCS) and Cardiac Action Potential

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_conduction_system> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_action_potential>

-   The Heart's Electrical System:

    -   The heart has an electrical system that controls its beating.
    -   This system is like the spark that starts the heart's contractions.
    -   Without it, the heart wouldn't pump blood.

-   The EKG:

    -   An EKG (electrocardiogram) only measures the heart's electrical activity, not how well it's pumping.
    -   Changes in the electrical system affect both how the heart works and what we see on an EKG.

-   Specialized Cells:

    -   The heart has special cells that create and transmit electrical signals.
    -   These signals cause the heart muscle to contract.
    -   The system ensures that all parts of the heart contract in the right order.

-   Components of the Conduction System:

    -   SA Node (Sinoatrial Node): The heart's main pacemaker. Located in the right atrium. Starts the electrical signal.
    -   Bachman's Bundle: Carries the signal from the SA node to the left atrium.

-   Internodal Pathways: Carry the signal from the SA node to the AV node.

-   AV Node (Atrioventricular Node):

    -   Delays the signal to allow the atria to fully contract before the ventricles.
    -   Located in the right atrium.

-   Bundle of His: Carries the signal from the AV node to the ventricles.

-   Right Bundle Branch: Carries the signal to the right ventricle.

-   Left Bundle Branch: Carries the signal to the left ventricle. Divides into left posterior fascicle and left anterior fascicle.

-   Purkinje Fibers: Connect the bundle branches to the heart muscle cells, causing them to contract.

-   Pacemaker Ability:

    -   Each part of the system has its own backup pacing rate.
    -   The SA node is the fastest pacemaker.
    -   If the SA node fails, lower parts of the system can take over, but at slower rates.

-   Electrophysiology:

    -   Depolarization: The process of the heart muscle cells becoming electrically charged. Involves the movement of ions (sodium, potassium, calcium) across cell membranes.
    -   Repolarization: The process of the heart muscle cells returning to their resting state.

-   The refractory period: is a brief time after a heart muscle cell contracts when it cannot be stimulated again. This is a protective mechanism that prevents the heart from going into a rapid, chaotic rhythm (arrhythmia).  

-   How Anti-arrhythmic Medications Affect Refractory Periods: Different classes of anti-arrhythmic medications work by altering the refractory periods of heart cells:  

    -   Class I (Sodium Channel Blockers): These drugs slow down the movement of sodium into heart cells, which prolongs the refractory period. This makes it harder for the heart to generate abnormal electrical signals that can cause arrhythmias.  

    -   Class II (Beta-Blockers): These drugs block the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) on the heart, which slows down the heart rate and prolongs the refractory period.  

    -   Class III (Potassium Channel Blockers): These drugs block potassium channels, which prolongs the action potential duration and the refractory period.  

    -   Class IV (Calcium Channel Blockers): These drugs slow the movement of calcium into heart cells, which can prolong the refractory period in some cases.  

    -   By adjusting the refractory periods, anti-arrhythmic medications can help to restore a normal heart rhythm.

-   Why is Refractory Period Important? Preventing Re-entry: Re-entry is a common mechanism of arrhythmias. It occurs when an electrical impulse circulates continuously within a loop of heart tissue. Prolonging the refractory period can break this loop and stop the arrhythmia.  

-   Controlling Heart Rate: By affecting the refractory period, anti-arrhythmic medications can slow down the heart rate and prevent rapid rhythms.  

-   Improving Cardiac Output: In some cases, anti-arrhythmic medications can improve the heart's ability to pump blood by controlling arrhythmias and restoring a normal rhythm.
